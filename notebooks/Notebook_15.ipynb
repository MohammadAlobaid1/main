Our function should be able to input the level we want to read, and be able to give us all the nodes on that level. Keep in mind, when we dig deeper into the tree we will be looking into more than one subtree, for example, the below tree, layer/level 2 are nodes `4 5 6 7`. \n",

The input should be the node we are looking as the root and the layer would be daughters that are under it. For the above picture, if we wanted all daughters for `1`, we would tell the code this and the output should be `4 5` only."
