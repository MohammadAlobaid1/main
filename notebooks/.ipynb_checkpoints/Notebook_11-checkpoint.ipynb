    "  * Temperature changes have _infinite number of states:_ it is always possible to potentially observe a temperature increase or decrease to a value that was never observed before;\n",
    "  * The screen of an electronic thermometer has _finite number of states,_ i.e. all the values that that thermometer can measure. For example, medical sub-lingual thermometer can measure values from 90F to 110F (35C to 42C). Given the finite number of digits that its screen can fit, the range of the temperatures expressed by the thermometer is finite.\n",

    "Finite state automata (FSA) have a finite list of possible **states** in which that machine can be, and these states have **transitions** defined in-between them. For example, we can observe a transition $A\\xrightarrow{\\text{x}}B$.\n",
    "It will mean that it is possible to get from state $A$ to the state $B$ by reading (\"accepting\") an \"x\".\n",
    "One state is **initial**, i.e. reading a string will always start from that state, and there is also a list of **final**, or **accepting** states, meaning that if the final state is activated when we are done reading the string, that string is accepted.\n",
