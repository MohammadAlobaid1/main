    "    with open(path_to_file, mode) as name_of_open_file:\n",
    "        # code where the open file is referred to as name_of_open_file\n",
    "        \n",
    "`path_to_file` is a string that points to the file that we want to open or create. The current notebook is in the `notebooks` repository, and therefore in order to give the adress of, for example,  `novartis_microsoft.txt`, we need to provide the following path: `'files/novartis_microsoft.txt'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`mode` is a string that defined the mode in which you are going to work with the file. The main modes are the following ones:\n",
    "  * `'r'` (read): in this case we expect the file with the indicated name to already exist, and we are going to read the file line-by-line, where lines are separated by a new line character from each other;\n",
    "  * `'w'` (write): opening a file with a writing mode will _create_ that file on the computer and will allow us to write strings into that file;\n",
    "  * `'a'` (append): opens an already existent files and allows to add new lines to the end of that file.\n",
    "  \n",
    "There are many other modes in which it is possible to open a file, but you can read about them on your own [here](https://stackabuse.com/file-handling-in-python/)."
